# 🏆 Nobel Prize Data Analysis Project

## 📊 About the Project
This project was developed using a dataset related to the Nobel Prize. After examining the relevant dataset, I performed the necessary data manipulations. I utilized libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to write queries based on the given cases, analyze the outputs, visualize the data, and provide insights.

## 🔍 Project Steps

### 1. 📥 Data Examination
I began by thoroughly examining the Nobel Prize dataset to understand its structure and the relationships between different variables.

### 2. 🔧 Data Manipulation
I applied necessary data manipulations using **Pandas** to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

### 3. 📈 Data Analysis and Visualization
I wrote queries based on the given cases, analyzed the outputs, and created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. The visualizations helped in interpreting the data effectively.

## 📁 Content
- **Nobel Prize Dataset**: The dataset containing information related to Nobel Prize winners.
- **Data Manipulation Scripts**: Python scripts demonstrating data cleaning and manipulation techniques.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs and charts created to illustrate the analysis results.

## 📄 Files
- **`nobel_prize_analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis and visualizations related to the Nobel Prize dataset.

## 🚀 Usage
1. You can open the Jupyter Notebook file (`nobel_prize_analysis.ipynb`) to review the analysis and visualizations.
2. Make sure to have the required libraries installed, such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, to run the code successfully.
